## What should you consider while designing an iOS app to support offline mode?

<br>

Designing an iOS app to support offline mode requires careful consideration of various aspects of the application. Here are some essential steps to follow:

**Use a local database or cache:**

You can use a local database or cache to store essential data offline, such as user preferences, previous searches, or downloaded content. SQLite, Core Data, or Realm are popular choices for iOS apps.

**Implement background fetch:**

Use the iOS Background Fetch feature to fetch new data in the background when an internet connection is available, without draining the battery. Ensure that you set a reasonable time interval between fetches.

**Implement intelligent syncing:**

Sync data intelligently, only fetching what's new, instead of all the data. You can achieve this by using an API that supports etags or last-modified headers.

**Provide partial functionality:**

Consider providing partial functionality in offline mode instead of locking the user out of the app entirely. For example, in a ride-hailing app, users could view their ride history and driver ratings in offline mode, but they cannot request a ride without an internet connection.

**Manage user expectations:**

Manage user expectations by providing clear feedback when the app is in offline mode. Provide informative error messages or UI elements that indicate when the app is offline.


**Cache images and media:**

Cache frequently used images, media, and other assets to reduce the number of API calls and provide a better user experience. You can also use lazy loading techniques to fetch images as the user scrolls through the app.

**Test thoroughly:**

Test your app in different scenarios, including low connectivity, airplane mode, or network switching. Consider using automated testing frameworks such as XCTest or Appium to cover more edge cases.

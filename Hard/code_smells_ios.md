**Question:**

## Why is code smells so important in iOS? What are the common code smells in Swift?

<br>

Code smells are indications of problematic areas in code that may cause maintainability, readability, or scalability issues.

### Code smells are important in iOS for several reasons:

* Maintenance: Code smells can make it more challenging to maintain and modify code over time.
* Readability: Code smells can make code harder to read, which can lead to misunderstandings, mistakes, and bugs.
* Scalability: Code smells can also affect the scalability of code. As the codebase grows, the complexity can increase, and code smells can compound.


### Here are some common code smells in iOS Swift:

* Long methods/functions: If a method or function is too long, it becomes difficult to read and maintain. It is a code smell that indicates the need for refactoring the code to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.
* Large classes: A class that has too many responsibilities can be hard to maintain and understand. It is a code smell that indicates the need for refactoring the code to create smaller, more focused classes.
* Duplicated code: If you see the same code in multiple places, it is a code smell that indicates the need for refactoring the code to extract the duplicated code into a single reusable method or function.
* Poor naming conventions: Poor naming conventions can make the code difficult to read and understand. It is a code smell that indicates the need for refactoring the code to use clear, descriptive names for variables, methods, and classes.
* Large view controllers: If a view controller is responsible for too many things, it becomes difficult to maintain and test. It is a code smell that indicates the need for refactoring the code to create smaller, more focused view controllers.
* Tight coupling: If there is a high degree of dependency between classes or modules, it becomes difficult to change one without affecting others. It is a code smell that indicates the need for refactoring the code to reduce coupling and increase cohesion.
* Lack of unit tests: If the code is not adequately tested, it is a code smell that indicates the need for refactoring the code to add unit tests.

Identifying and addressing code smells can lead to code that is easier to maintain, understand, and scale. This, in turn, can lead to higher quality code that is easier to collaborate on and ultimately more successful software products.
